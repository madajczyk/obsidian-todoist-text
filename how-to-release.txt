from https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs/publishing/release-your-plugin-with-github-actions#use-standard-version-to-automatically-tag-your-release

1. `npm run release`
2. check the version it will produce. If it's not right, use `npm run release -- --release-as minor` or `npm run release -- --release-as major`
3. `git push --follow-tags origin master`
4. wait for github action to finish
