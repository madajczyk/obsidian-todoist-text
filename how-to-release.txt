1. Make sure that the commits since last release are prepended with either `"feat: commit msg"` or `"fix: commit msg"` or `" BREAKING CHANGE: commit msg"`. Each commit with this message will show up in the changelog, so squash/rebase as necessary for those commit messages to be readable.
2. `npm run release`
3. `git push --follow-tags origin master`
4. wait for github action to finish
